The first time you do
```python
import myjuliamod
```
The Julia packages should be installed and optionally compiled.



To test, try this
```python
[1]: from myjuliamod import hello
  Activating project at `~/code/github/username/julia_project/examples/myjuliamod/myjuliamod`

In [2]: hello()
Out[2]: 'Hello, myjuliamod'
```
